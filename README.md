# COMP6630_ML_Final_Project
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for binary image classification. MLP coded from scratch in partial fulfillment of COMP 6630 | Machine Learning, Auburn University. 
## Project Description:
World hunger is a growing issue in post-pandemic society.  According to the World Food Program, as many as 828 million people go to bed hungry every night \hl{cite}. This has made a push to improve the technical resources available to farmers. The motivation for this project is to utilize a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to identify diseased tomato leaves, as an early detection method to prevent spread and improve crop yields. Results are promising at 79.4 percent accuracy on a k-fold crossvalidation test set. Methods for determining optimal hyperparamters are shown, and compared against a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Resnet18 as well as a stock open source MLP from SKLearn.
